# Movies-Backend-Project

This is a Project about Movies. 

In this Project we have to develop a movie search and management web application that includes a some functionalities and associated endpoints. We will work on the concepts seen in Frontend and Backend in class. 

The application will have two different roles: User and Administrator. The functionalities that will appear both in the control panel and in the rest of the endpoints will change depending on the type of user, never being able to access those areas or contents that do not correspond to them.
